ScottNix, a child theme for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

A child theme for Thematic 2.0, this is a WIP, there is no design yet, just updating everything to current standards in anticipation for the release of Thematic 2.0. This will eventually power my website and also be available for download.


Todo
-------------

* Update Susy grids to latest standards, drop old syntax.
* Incorporate Tim's Emwaw (http://emwaw.me/) to detach some of the styling/naming issues that are present from creating themes meant to be modified.
* Create a new design, will be somewhat similar to old design, possibly even more simple.
* Spend way too much time picking a friggin color scheme.
