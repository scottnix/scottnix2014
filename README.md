ScottNix, a child theme for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

A child theme for Thematic 2.0, this is a constant WIP (Work in Progress). This theme was built to get everything to current standards for the release of Thematic 2.0.

This now powers my website, although if you wanted something to use for new sites, check out https://github.com/scottnix/responsive-base-plus which was built from this theme, but I stripped down all the super custom stuff so you don't have to strip this theme.


Todo
-------------

* ~~Clean CSS Files, need to really pick through the CSS to find unused/duplicate stuff that is laying around. I pieced this theme together with a couple previous themes, so there is likely to be really minor duplicate, or uneccessary CSS.~~
* ~~Clean PHP Files, still need to comment and organize the functions.php file-~~
* ~~Strip this theme to nothing and replace the Responsive Base theme, a starter theme for Thematic.~~
* Figure out how to get Susy to not even bother with the box-model, since it is covered by the border boxing everything.
